## Predicting Evictions in New York City 

New York City is one of the most socioeconomically stratified and geographically segregated cities in the United States. As such, it is not uncommon for more vulnerable populations, such as low income communities or communities of color, to find themselves at the mercy of those with greater access to resources and power in our city – there is no clearer example than in New York City’s countless evictions and failure to provide accessible and affordable housing.

By building this model, my hope was to better understand both the factors that fuel evictions and to provide targeted support to individuals in these vulnerable areas. This model can be thought of as a basic template that can be customized based on the availability of data and the unique factors of each city or town. As this was an exercise in experimentation, my regression equation was relatively simple: 

Number of evictions_i= β_0 + β_1(Proportion of Black Residents)+ β_2(Median Income)+ β_3(Proportion of Evictions by ZIP Code)
