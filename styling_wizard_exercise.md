## Creating Maps with Google's Map Styling Wizard

## Getting Started

For this assignment, I chose to develop a map for the National Audubon Society ("Audubon"), a non-profit dedicated to the conservation and study of birds and their habitats. While the organization consists primarily of enthusiastic ornithologists and conservationists, they rely heavily on the participation of the general public -- amateur birders and donors both have a role to play in the conservation movement. 

The organization does not have a consistent or clear visual style. While the images of regional birds are colorful and draw the eye, the maps included on their website already look [a bit out of place](https://www.audubon.org/about/audubon-near-you), with fairly chaotic coloring. This encouraged me to attempt to style a map based on one of the images they were already sharing on their website.  

I took a screenshot of Audobon's [Guide to North American Birds](https://www.audubon.org/bird-guide), which features a Cedar Waxwing. The color on this bird seemed to be the most dynamic, and I thought it would give me a more flexible palette to play around with. 

Adobe generated the following palette from the image:

In order to input the colors into the Styling Wizard, the Hex Codes needed to be converted into an RGB format:
